## Due Date, Next Meeting - Thursday, October 27, 2022

### Data Pre-processing
1. **Jolly** - Pneumonia, COVID-19 dataset
2. **Abhishek** - Pneumonia dataset
3. **Rohan**- Chest X-Ray 8 Dataset

All pre-processing needs to be done using PyTorch
Pre-processing functions to write
- Re-size image
- Flip image horizontally
- Change contrast of the image
- Histogram equalization + gaussian blur (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265949)
- Adaptive masking (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265949)
- Other techniques used by kaggle users

### Model Explainability
**Harman**

- Pick a working notebook from the #1 Pneumonia, COVID-19 dataset (consult Jolly) and run it end-to-end to get the trained model and predictions.
- Apply SHAP on this model and generate visualizations
- Apply GradCAM on this model and generate visualizations
